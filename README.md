Ft_printf - Custom Printf Function Implementation

Welcome to ft_printf, a custom implementation of the printf function in C. This project focuses on creating a versatile and efficient printf function, providing enhanced formatting capabilities beyond the standard printf found in the C library.

** Project Overview **

- What does ft_printf do?
      - ft_printf is designed to replicate the functionality of the standard C printf function while offering additional features and customization options. It supports a wide range of format specifiers, including those for integers, strings, characters, pointers, and more. Additionally, this implementation allows for the creation of custom format specifiers, providing flexibility for advanced formatting requirements.

- Key Features
    - Extended Format Specifiers: Beyond the standard specifiers, ft_printf supports custom specifiers, enabling users to define their own format rules.
    - Modular Design: The implementation is divided into modular components, making it easy to understand, extend, and customize.
    - Error Handling: Includes robust error handling to provide informative messages in case of format errors or unsupported specifiers.

** How to Compile ft_printf **

To compile the ft_printf function, follow these straightforward steps:

  - Clone the Repository:
      - git clone git@github.com:Bgarnn/01-Ft_printf.git
      - cd 01-Ft_printf
  - Compile the Function:
      - make: This will generate the static library containing the ft_printf function.
  - Clean the Build:
      - make clean: This removes the object files, leaving only the compiled library.
